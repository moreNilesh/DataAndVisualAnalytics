Pig script uses AWS services S3 and EMR to analyze large datasets - Google bigrams.

1. For each unique bigram, compute its average number of appearances per book

2. Output the 10 bigrams with the highest average number of appearances per book along with
their corresponding average sorted in descending order. If multiple bigrams have the same
average, put them in alphabetical order.

Example - 
Input:
I am 1936 342 90
I am 1945 211 10
very cool 1923 500 10
very cool 1980 3210 1000
very cool 2012 9994 3020

Output - 
I am 5.53
very cool 3.40049628
