Graph layout used 'yifan hu' because we could clearly see dense and less populated areas with this layout.

In this layout varying edge length allows visualizing clustered areas and non-clustered  areas distinctly. 
Edge length is small for nodes with more high degree and edge length is long for nodes with less degree.

I have kept node color as red and node size as 15 for nodes with degree in range 24 to 30.   
For nodes with degree 15 to 23, I have kept color as green and size as 14.
And for remaing nodes, I kept the default properties.

This representation helps to partition graph in three distinct regions.
One partition having tracks with most similar songs.
Another with more than average number of similar songs and last partition with averagare or little more then average 
number of similar songs.

I did not see any point in altering edge thickness, since edges have no weight associated with them.
