Q1.3-c  
Scaling node sizes.
Adjust the radius of each node in the graph based on how “cool” each character is. In the provided json file there is a “coolness” rating for each character.

Scaling the node radii by Square root works better because it makes radii of less cool nodes(characters) much less than 
with that linear scale approcah. And radii of cool characters is increased compared to linear approach.

This VISUALLY FILTERS OUT less cool characters, 
hence less cluttering and helps to focus on nodes of significance(Assuming Cool characters are what we intersted in). 

Q1.4.
Filtering node labels. Only show the labels for “cool” characters.Only draw
labels for the characters with coolness factor above 25 (i.e., coolness > 25). What do
you think about the new appearance in comparison with the old one ?


This approach obviously reduces the cluttering and if we are interested in Cool characters this approach helps to focus on them.
If we are interested in other characteristic, we can apply similar filtering schemes for better visual experience and interaction.

Q1.7-b

As you increase gravity, nodes become more cluttered towards centre of the graph. Hence I reduced gravity to 0.05.
Also increasing negative charge to -200 helps since nodes repel each other with more negative charge.
I increased link distance to 60. That also seems to help.
